# Customer-segmentation-analysis
## 1. Introduction:
Customer segmentation is a critical process for business to understand each group of customers’ needs, preferences, and behaviors. Therefore, business can develop the effective marketing strategy and campaign to each customer segment.
In this report, we will explore a dataset of 2,000 customers collected through loyalty cards. Using this dataset, we will perform customer segmentation analysis. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their attributes such as gender, age, marital status, income, education, occupation and the size of the city that the customer lives in. 
This customer segementation analysis is expected to provide marketing strategy recommendations to the business management on how to target these customer segments effectively.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
First of all, we has performed the visualisation to have a overview of the group of 2,000 customers.
- Gender: There is a fairly balanced representation of males and females.
- Marital Status: A number of customers are single is quite similar to those who are non-single.
- Age: The age of customers ranges are widely from 18 and 76 years old, with a average age of 36 years old.
- Income: Most customers have income range from $35K 𝑡𝑜 $309K. The average income is approximately $120K.
- Education: Majority of customers complete high school. 15% out of 2,0000 customers have university-level education, and 14% out of 2,0000 customers fall under the "Other/Unknown" category.
- Occupation: The largest group are skilled employees or officials. The second largest group is unemployed or unskilled. The dataset also includes customers who work in management level, self-employed and high quality employees
- Settlement (size of city where customer lives in): The majority of customers come from small cities, followed by mid-sized cities, and then big cities.

## 3. Customer Segmentation:
3.1. Find the optimal number of clusters (customer segments)
We will use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (customer segments).
3.2. Estimate and analyse customer segments
We will use two clustering techniques: KMeans and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to estimate the clusters.
3.3. Compare the clusters identified by the two techniques

## 4. Recommendations of marketing techniques for the target customer segments:
- Middle-Aged Affluent Females, Highest Income
- Young Economical Males, Average Income
- Middle-Aged Affluent Females, Highest Income

## 5. Conclusion:
In this analysis report,we focused on indentify the most appropriate customer segments to understand distinct groups for the business marketing’s strategy development. These segments represent unique characteristics in terms of gender, age, marital status, income, education, occupation and settlement size. We also proposed the marketing strategies for each segment to enhance sales effectiveness. The consistency in segment profiles across both clustering methods has supported for data-driven marketing decisions for the business in the future.
